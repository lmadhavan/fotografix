This folder is scanned once upon starting Fotografix. All files with a .png extension
in this folder will appear in the list of available brushes. Subfolders are IGNORED.

Brush files are grayscale PNG images representing the alpha channel (transparency) of
the final brush used for painting. If you use a colour image, the red channel will be
used as the alpha channel, and the other channels are ignored.
